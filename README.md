* The present code is part of my grade thesis in Electrical Engineering at the University of Costa Rica.

* The main objective is to prove the hypothesis that based on Local Field Potential measurments from the Entorhinal Cortex of the Hippocampus of rats is possible to extract angular information of the head direction of the subject. 

* The dataset used in this experiment is: [BuszakiLab HC-3 Dataset](https://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-3/about-hc-3/?searchterm=LFP).

* In order to do so, machine learning algorithms will be applied to the data, such as Feedforward Neural Network, RNNs and CNNs.
